# ScaenaCraft – Name Tag Recipe (Preview)

This datapack adds a **preview crafting recipe for name tags** on ScaenaCraft.

Minecraft has announced craftable name tags in an upcoming Java Edition release. This datapack safely previews that idea **without upgrading the server version**.

## Recipe (Preview)

- **Paper**  
- **Any Nugget** (iron, gold, copper when available)

→ **Name Tag**

The recipe uses the vanilla `minecraft:nuggets` item tag, so newly added nugget types will be supported automatically.

## Installation

1. Place this datapack folder (or zip) into your world’s `datapacks/` directory.
2. Restart the server.
3. Confirm it is enabled with `/datapack list`.

## Important Notes

- This is a **preview feature**, not the final vanilla recipe.
- The recipe may change or be removed when Minecraft releases the official version.
- Existing name tags will continue to work normally.

## Scope

This datapack only adds a crafting recipe.  
It does not modify mobs, trades, loot tables, or game rules.
